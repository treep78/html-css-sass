      <h1>Alan Turing</h1>

      <p class="quote">Turing is widely considered to be the father of
      theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <p>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954)
      was a British pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician,
      cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the
      development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of
      the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which
      can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely
      considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial
      intelligence.</p>

      <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and
      Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking
      centre. For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval
      cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German
      ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method and an
      electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
      Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that
      enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements,
      including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that this work
      shortened the war in Europe by as many as two to four years.</p>

      <p>After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he
      designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer.
      In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Laboratory at the University
      of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became
      interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis
      of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
      Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.</p>

      <p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour
      was still a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES
      (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16
      days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
      determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known
      evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009,
      following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made
      an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the
      appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous
      pardon in 2013.</p>
